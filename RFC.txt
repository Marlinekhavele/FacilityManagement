# Inventory Management System for Gas Storage Facilities

## Overview
This document outlines the rationale and design of a web-based inventory management system for gas storage facilities. 
The system is designed to efficiently manage and organize facility components while providing an intuitive user experience using Django, HTMX, and Bootstrap.

## Problem Statement

Gas storage facilities require a structured and scalable system to track their components efficiently. The main challenges include:
- Managing a hierarchical inventory structure.
- Providing real-time, dynamic interactions without full page reloads.
- Ensuring seamless user experience with infinite scrolling, filtering, and sorting.
- Allowing quick component creation through modals.

## Solution Overview

To address these challenges,I propose a Django-based web application utilizing HTMX for lightweight,reactive front-end interactions. The key features include:
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Dynamically loads more components as users scroll.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Allows users to refine results based on search terms and inventory levels.
- **Component Creation via Modal**: Enables users to add components without navigating away from the page.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python) with PostgreSQL.
- **Frontend**: HTMX, Bootstrap for styling.
- **Database**: Relational schema using Django ORM.

## Database Schema





## Conclusion

This RFC outlines a robust solution for managing gas storage inventory efficiently. By leveraging Django and HTMX, we achieve:
- A fast, responsive interface without full-page reloads.
- A scalable database schema for structured inventory management.
- An intuitive user experience with infinite scrolling and modal-based interactions.

Future enhancements could include user authentication, role-based access control, and API integrations with external systems.
